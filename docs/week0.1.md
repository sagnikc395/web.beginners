- Industry uses:

## HTML jargon

- defines the structure of the website.
- what should be places after what, before what etc.
- jargon that we need to know of:

  - tags
  - attributes

- popular HTML tags:

  - \<html>
  - \<head>
  - \<title>
  - \<body>
  - \<div> / \<span>
  - \<h1> ... \<h6>
  - \<p>
  - \<img>
  - \<a>
  - input
  - \<button>
  - \<b> /<i>
  - \<center >

- even without any html tag we can write the content, but with tags we can create structure.

- \<div> is the most popular tag -> take 1 full width of your page. It more , then it will just overflow into the next line.

- \<html> , \<head> \<body> etc. are high level tags that are good to know for structuring the body and the actual content goes into body and head has metadata and import external scripts.

- div takes up all the space in the given line.
- to structure this between structurally and on the same line, we can use the span tag i.e in the inner children
- p and div are alsmost same .
- can change the default style of a tag via css.

- for making navigation use a tag , target= \_blank makes the blank search.
- b is for making your content as bold, i is for italic text.

- button tag lets us create a button, the pointer and color changes -> natively they look pretty ugly in HTML.

- buttons need some functionality associated with them , when user do onclick, onhover etc.

- input tag is to get user input

- any website is just made up of a bunch of tags and has recursive patterns of tags and items inside.
- no end of the amount of tags we can learn, can learn them over time

### Attributes:

- src, href ,onclick ,id etc are called attributes of a tag.
- extra things that we can pass onto the tags.
- some common ones:
  \<img src="">
  \<a href=" "></a>
  \<button onclick="">
  \<input id="username">
