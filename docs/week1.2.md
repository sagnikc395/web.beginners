## Javascript Foundation

### why languages ?

- need to represent logic for human understandable thing and to make it easier for us to program and to effectively program from a higher level representation to a lower level representation.
- everything will actually go to 0s and 1s into the RAM.
- the compiler/interpreter will convert from a english like syntax to 0s and 1s.
- developers are very dumb and require a high level representation and want a high level programming language to convert the code.
- Languages are all written to write large scale software applications.

### Interpreted vs Compiled Languages

- compilers convert high level developer friendly code into 0s and 1s.

### Why JS >> other languages in some use-cases

### Strict vs Dynamic Languages

### Single Threaded Nature of JS

### Simple Primitives in JS(Numbers,strings, booleans)

### Complex Primitives in JS(Arrays,Objects)

### Functions in Javascript

### Practice Problem Solving

### Callback functions,Event loop, Callback Queue, Async programming

### callback hell and promises.
